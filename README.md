This is a simple MCP server that sends emails using Resend's API. Why? Now you can let Cursor or Claude Desktop compose emails for you and send it right away without having to copy and paste the email content.

As an example, you could use this to run local scripts, chat with Claude, or process data and send the results to yourself or your team.

Built with:

- [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- [Anthropic MCP](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.so/)

## Features

- Send plain text and HTML emails
- Schedule emails for future delivery
- Add CC and BCC recipients
- Configure reply-to addresses
- Customizable sender email (requires verification)

## Setup

Currently, you must build the project locally to use this MCP server. Then add the server in [Cursor](#cursor) or [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop) to use it in any Cursor or Claude Desktop chat.

1. Clone this project locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/resend/mcp-send-email.git
```

2. Build the project

```
npm install
npm run build
```
3. Setup Resend

Create a free Resend account and [Create an API Key](https://resend.com/api-keys). To send to other addresses, you'll also need to [verify your own domain](https://resend.com/domains).

> [!NOTE]
> For more info on how to send emails with Resend, see the [docs](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nodejs).

## Cursor

    }
  }
}
```

You can get the absolute path to your build script by right-clicking on the `/build/index.js` file in Cursor and selecting `Copy Path`.

3. Test the sending

Now you can test out sending emails by going to `email.md`.
- Replace the to: email address with your own
- Select all text in `email.md`, and press `cmd+l`
- Tell cursor to "send this as an email" in the chat (make sure cursor is in Agent mode by selecting "Agent" on lower left side dropdown).
